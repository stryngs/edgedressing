## Who
This is for Microsoft, please stop this nonsense.

## What
duster fingerprints the browser.

## When
Are we still in the 80s?  Trust is not inherit and NCSI probes are plain silly, surely there has to be a better way for your icons.  The cure works but the breaks in the UX make it better to keep such a disease...

## Where
Anywhere somebody has wifi enabled and is using Windows.

## How
ChatGPT and live testing feedback to the prompt.

## Why
I was bored.  I love hacking wifi and there hasn't been anything new to do in quite the while.  I figured it'd be cool to come up with an endpoint for this vector concept.  [BeEF](https://beefproject.com/) absolutely came to mind but the issue with such a tool is that if the user closes the browser the vector dies and well, hmm.  What information can we grab during the short time the browser will be open?
