## What
buster is a template example for attempting to collect clipboard content, username/passwords via social engineering, and finally redirects away so that the user won't dwell on having just entered in potentially sensitive information.

If duster is listening buster leverages a hidden iframe and the server duster is listening on will receive the fingerprint info.

As more payloads get added they will be chained if buster is used.  If chaining for buster is not wanted simply find the iframes in index.html and comment out accordingly.
